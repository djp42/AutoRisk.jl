Notes:
1. trajdata frames are stored with the last frame last, so 
    get!(scene, trajdata, 1) gets the first frame and 
    get!(scene, trajdata, last_frame_idx) gets the last frame added.
2. scene records are the opposite in the sense that in calling update! 
    on a scene record, you want to do so in the order the scenes occurred 
    so that the most recent scene is stored first in the record.
    - scene records must also have multiple frames loaded into them to 
        compute certain features (e.g., accel and velocity)
    - pastframe indexing is with negative values
